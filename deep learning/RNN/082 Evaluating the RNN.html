<p>as seen in the practical lectures, the RNN we built was a regressor. Indeed, we were dealing with Regression because we were trying to predict a continuous outcome (the Google Stock Price). For Regression, the way to evaluate the model performance is with a metric called RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). It is calculated as the root of the mean of the squared differences between the predictions and the real values.</p>









<p>However for our specific Stock Price Prediction problem, evaluating the model with the RMSE does not make much sense, since we are more interested in the directions taken by our predictions, rather than the closeness of their values to the real stock price. We want to check if our predictions follow the same directions as the real stock price and we donâ€™t really care whether our predictions are close the real stock price. The predictions could indeed be close but often taking the opposite direction from the real stock price.</p>









<p>Nevertheless if you are interested in the code that computes the RMSE for our Stock Price Prediction problem, please find it just below:</p>









<pre class="prettyprint linenums">import math
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
rmse = math.sqrt(mean_squared_error(real_stock_price, predicted_stock_price))</pre>











<p>Then consider dividing this RMSE by the range of the Google Stock Price values of January 2017 (that is around 800) to get a relative error, as opposed to an absolute error. It is more relevant since for example if you get an RMSE of 50, then this error would be very big if the stock price values ranged around 100, but it would be very small if the stock price values ranged around 10000.</p>









<p>Enjoy Deep Learning!</p></p>
